# Log Files Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the application. All log files are excluded from git via .gitignore.

## Common Log Files

- `data_processing.log` - Logs from PDF document processing and vector embedding
- `reset_script.log` - Logs from vector store reset operations
- `app.log` - Main application logs

## Purpose

The logs directory is automatically created by the application. Log files provide detailed information about:

- Document processing operations
- Vector store operations (add, search, delete)
- API requests and responses
- Errors and exceptions

## Retention

Log files are not automatically rotated or deleted. For production deployments, consider implementing log rotation to prevent excessive disk usage.
