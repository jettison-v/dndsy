Chapter 1: Character Options

Welcome adventurers! This chapter delves into the new choices available for crafting your unique heroes in the 2024 ruleset.

Druid: Circle of the Stars
Star druids draw power from the cosmos. At 2nd level, they gain the Star Map feature, allowing them to consult constellations for guidance. They also gain the Starry Form ability, letting them expend uses of Wild Shape to assume a luminous form associated with a specific constellation, granting different benefits:
- Archer: Bonus action ranged spell attack.
- Chalice: Bonus action healing for allies.
- Dragon: Minimum roll bonus on Intelligence or Wisdom checks.

Later levels grant abilities like Cosmic Omen and Twinkling Constellations, further enhancing their connection to the celestial bodies.

Feats
Feats offer ways to customize your character beyond their class features. 

New Feat: Arcane Dabbler
Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature
You learn two cantrips of your choice from any spell list. For an additional benefit, choose one 1st-level spell from any spell list. You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. Your spellcasting ability for these spells depends on the list you chose them from (Intelligence for wizard, Wisdom for cleric/druid, Charisma for bard/sorcerer/warlock/paladin).

This feat is excellent for characters wanting a touch more magical versatility outside their primary class list.
